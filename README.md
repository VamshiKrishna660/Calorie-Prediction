# Calorie Prediction Using Regression

This project develops a regression-based model for predicting calorie consumption by analyzing various features. The model utilizes user demographics, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature to provide accurate calorie estimates tailored to individual profiles and activity levels.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each user
- **Gender**: Gender of the user
- **Age**: Age of the user
- **Height**: Height of the user (in cm)
- **Weight**: Weight of the user (in kg)
- **Duration**: Duration of exercise (in minutes)
- **Heart_Rate**: Heart rate during exercise (in bpm)
- **Body_Temp**: Body temperature during exercise (in Â°C)
- **Calories**: Calories burned during the exercise

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   github.com/VamshiKrishna660/Calories-Prediction
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab or your local environment.
3. Run the code cells to execute the calorie prediction model.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- XGBoost (for XGBRegressor)
